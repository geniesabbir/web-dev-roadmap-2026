## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Follow the phases in order** - Each builds on the previous
2. **Complete the exercises** - Practice is everything
3. **Build the projects** - Apply what you learn immediately
4. **Update your progress** - Check off completed topics
5. **Take notes** - Add your own notes in each section
6. **Be consistent** - Regular practice beats cramming

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to phase 1
cd phase-1-foundations/01-html-css

# Read the README for that section
cat README.md

# Start coding!
```

## Core Principles

1. **Learn by doing** - Every section has hands-on exercises
2. **Build real projects** - Not just tutorials
3. **Understand the "why"** - Don't just memorize syntax
4. **Version control everything** - Commit your progress
5. **Embrace the struggle** - Confusion means you're learning

## Why This Roadmap Works in 2026

### Modern Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18+, Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express/Fastify, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Vercel, Railway, AWS basics
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, RAG systems, prompt engineering

### AI-Era Ready
This roadmap focuses on skills AI can't replace:
- **System design** - Understanding the "why" behind architecture
- **Problem-solving** - Translating business needs to code
- **Full-stack thinking** - Seeing how all pieces connect
- **Human skills** - Communication, collaboration, judgment

### Learn WITH AI, Not FROM AI
- Use AI tools to accelerate learning (Claude, Copilot, Cursor)
- Build muscle memory by coding without AI daily
- Focus on understanding, not just copying

See the full [AI Era Guide](./AI-ERA-GUIDE.md) for strategies.
