This phase transforms you from knowing JavaScript to building production-ready frontend applications. React is the most in-demand frontend framework, and Next.js is the industry standard for React applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this phase, ensure you:
- Completed Phase 1 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Git)
- Can build interactive pages with vanilla JavaScript
- Understand ES6+ features and async programming
- Are comfortable with TypeScript basics

- Components and JSX
- Props and State
- Event Handling
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists and Keys
- Forms in React
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)

### 2. [React Advanced Patterns](./02-react-advanced/README.md) (2-3 weeks)
- Custom Hooks
- Context API
- useReducer for complex state

- Middleware
- Image and Font Optimization

### 4. [State Management](./04-state-management/README.md) (1-2 weeks)
- When to use what
- Zustand (recommended)
- Redux Toolkit (for complex apps)
- React Query / TanStack Query
- Server State vs Client State

### 5. [Testing](./05-testing/README.md) (1 week)
- Testing philosophy
- Jest basics
- React Testing Library
- Testing hooks
- Integration tests
- E2E with Playwright

## Phase 2 Projects

### Project 1: Task Management App
- CRUD operations
- Filtering and sorting
- Drag and drop
- Local storage persistence
- Responsive design

### Project 2: E-commerce Product Page

## Tips for Success

1. **Build, don't just watch** - Tutorials are starting points
2. **Read the docs** - React and Next.js docs are excellent
3. **Think in components** - Break UI into reusable pieces
4. **TypeScript everything** - Get type errors early
5. **Test as you build** - Not after
