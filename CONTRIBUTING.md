## 🛠️ Contributing Improvements

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

### What We're Looking For

✅ **Accepted contributions:**
- Fix typos or grammatical errors
- Update outdated information (new framework versions, deprecated tools)
- Add helpful resources (free courses, tools, articles)
- Improve explanations that are confusing
- Add missing topics that are industry-relevant
- Better code examples
- Translations (create a new folder like `translations/es/`)

❌ **Not accepted:**
- Adding paid courses/resources as primary recommendations
- Promotional content
- Major structural changes without discussion
- Content that doesn't fit the roadmap's scope

### How to Submit a PR

1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/typo-in-react-section
   # or
   git checkout -b add/new-resource-for-typescript
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Keep changes focused and minimal
   - Follow existing formatting
   - Test any code examples you add

4. **Commit with a clear message**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: typo in React fundamentals section"
   # or
   git commit -m "add: new TypeScript practice resource"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   Then open a Pull Request on GitHub

### Commit Message Format

Use these prefixes:
- `fix:` - Corrections (typos, errors, broken links)
- `add:` - New content (resources, examples, sections)
- `update:` - Updates to existing content
- `docs:` - Documentation improvements
- `refactor:` - Restructuring without changing content

### PR Guidelines

- **One topic per PR** - Don't mix multiple unrelated changes
- **Describe your changes** - Explain what and why
- **Link issues** - If your PR fixes an issue, reference it

1. **Open an Issue** - Describe your suggestion
